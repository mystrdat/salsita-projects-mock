      <h3>Embracing complex challenges</h3>
      <p>Weâ€™ve assembled a hand-picked team of university-educated computer scientists who thrive on complex projects. But we offer more than software engineers: we have an interdisciplinary team of specialists under one roof, from graphic design and user experience through HTML/CSS and full stack development to quality assurance and dev ops. Our engineers can augment an existing project team or handle an entire project from wireframing to deployment.</p>
      <p>When you hire Salsita, you get more than an individual: you get the support of a full-service team and our tried-and-true Salsita Development Process to guide your project from start to finish.</p>
      <p>For the price of one engineer, we deliver the dependability, breadth of skills and consistent quality of a world-class team.</p>
